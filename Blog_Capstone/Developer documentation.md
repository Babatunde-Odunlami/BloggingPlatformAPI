## Environment Setup

### Install Dependencies

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Babatunde-Odunlami/BloggingPlatformAPI/
   cd  ./Blog_Capstone/BlogProject
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```plaintext
   SECRET_KEY='your-secret-key'
   DEBUG=True
   ```

## Running the Project Locally

1. Apply migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

3. Access the app at `https://tundebedev.pythonanywhere.com/users/`.

5. Apply database migrations on the live server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
6. Collect static files:
   ```bash
   python manage.py collectstatic
   ```
7. Configure the `.env` file for production settings.
8. Restart the PythonAnywhere web app.

## Code Style and Best Practices

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines.
- Use descriptive commit messages.
- Write modular and reusable code.
- Add comments and docstrings for clarity.

## Contribution Guidelines
